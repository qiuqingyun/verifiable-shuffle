# This parameter determine which version of the program is executed.
# 0 stands for no optimization inside of the code
# 1 uses multi-exponentiation techniques
# 2 uses multi-exponentiation techniques and FFT to find values E_i
# 3 uses multi-exponentiation techniques, extra interaction and Toom-Cook 4 to find values E_i, in this case m =16 or 64\n

# Actual number of ciphertext used in the shuffle protocol
400

# Dimension of the m x n matrix used in the protocol. First line corresponds to number of rows m,
# second line corresponds to number of columns n
16

# Window size for the sliding window multi-exponentiation technique; default value is 5 for q 160 bits else 6
6

# Window size of the multi-exponentiation technique by Lim and Lee; default value is 5
5

# Window size of the multi-exponentiation technique by Brickels et al.; default value is 7

# Types of groups uses.
# 0 the same modular group G is used for the commitments and the encryption
# 1 the commitments are calculated in G subset Z_p_1 with order q and the encryption in H subset Z_p_2 with order q
0

# Name of the file consisting the description of the groups used in the protocol
# If only one group is used the file should consist of the prime p, prime order q,  a generator of G   and a generator of Z_q
# If two different groups are used the file should consist of the prime p, prime order q, a generator of G, a generator of Z_q, the prime p1 and a generator of H
# Or set parameter to 0 if you want to define groups of own choice.

# Number of bits of prime order q

# Number of bits of prime p
20

# Number of bits of prime p1; if two different groups are used.
